This repository provides the **official implementation** of the paper:

> **Collision-Free Humanoid Traversal in Cluttered Indoor Scenes**
> *Han Xue et al.*
> arXiv preprint: [arXiv:2601.16035](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16035).`<br>`
> project page: [https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/](https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/).

The project addresses the problem of enabling humanoid robots to safely traverse **cluttered indoor scenes**, which we define as environments that simultaneously exhibit:

- **Full-spatial constraints**: obstacles jointly present at the *ground*, *lateral*, and *overhead* levels, restricting the humanoid’s motion in all spatial dimensions.
- **Intricate geometries**: obstacles with complex, irregular shapes that go beyond simple primitives such as rectangular blocks or regular polyhedra.

</p>

In this repository, we present:

- **Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF)**: a structured representation encoding spatial relationships between the humanoid body and surrounding obstacles;
- **Hybrid scene generation**: realistic 3D indoor scene crops combined with procedurally synthesized obstacles;
- **Reinforcement learning for specialist and generalist policies**, respectively trained on specific scenes and distilled to a generalist policy.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalaxyGeneralRobotics/Click-and-Traverse.git
cd Click-and-Traverse
```

### 2. Environment setup

CUDA 12.5 is recommended.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.5/bin:$PATH  # adjust if needed
uv sync -i https://pypi.org/simple
```

### 3. Configuration

Create and customize the `.env` file in the repository root. This file defines runtime configurations such as:

- working directory paths
- logging (e.g., WandB account)
- experiment identifiers

### 4. Initialize MuJoCo assets

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
source .env
python -m cat_ppo.utils.mj_playground_init
```

## Hybrid Obstacle Generation & HumanoidPF

Two categories of obstacle scenes are supported:

- **Typical obstacles**: manually designed, semantically meaningful scenes
- **Random obstacles**: procedurally generated scenes with controllable difficulty

HumanoidPF representations are generated synchronously for all scenes.

Outputs are saved to:

- `data/assets/TypiObs/`
- `data/assets/RandObs/`

### Generate Typical Obstacles

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.5/bin:$PATH
source .env
source .venv/bin/activate
cd procedural_obstacle_generation
```

Edit `main.py` and call:

```python
generate_typical_obstacle(obs_name)
```

Parameters:

- `obs_name`: the obstacle configuration (see comments in `main.py`).

### Generate Random Obstacles

Call in `main.py`:

```python
generate_random_obstacle(difficulty, seed, dL, dG, dO)
```

Parameters:

- `difficulty`: global difficulty level
- `seed`: random seed
- `dL`: lateral obstacle difficulty
- `dG`: ground obstacle difficulty
- `dO`: overhead obstacle difficulty

## Traversal Skill Learning

### Training

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.5/bin:$PATH
source .env
source .venv/bin/activate
python train_batch.py
```

If you want to train a specific experiment, you can run:

```bash
python -m train_ppo --task {task} --restore_name {restore_name} --exp_name {exp_name}  --ground {ground} --lateral {lateral} --overhead {overhead} --term_collision_threshold {term_collision_threshold} --obs_path {obs_path}
```

Supported tasks:

- `G1Cat`: default task (can be directly used for sim-to-real deployment)
- `G1CatPri`: privileged task (privileged observation is more informative for distilling generalist policies)

Refer to `train_batch.py` for args details.

### brax2onnx

`train_batch.py` will automatically convert checkpoints to ONNX format. But if you customize the policy architecture, you may need to convert checkpoints to ONNX manually:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.brax2onnx \
  --task G1Cat \
  --exp_name exp_name
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model without privileged observation, run:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.mj_onnx_play --task G1Cat --exp_name 12051223_G1LocoPFR10_OdonoiseSlowV2_xP2xMxK00xlowcorner --obs_path data/assets/TypiObs/lowcorner
```

To evaluate the model with privileged observation, run:

```bash
python -m cat_ppo.eval.mj_onnx_play --task G1CatPri --pri --exp_name G1CatPri_narrow1 --obs_path data/assets/TypiObs/narrow1
```
